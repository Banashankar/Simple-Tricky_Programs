#Algorithm for non repitative character in string :set
------------------------------------------------------
We create a Set called uniqueChars.
As we iterate through the string, we check whether each character (ignoring non-letter characters) is already in the set.
If not, we print it and add it to the set.

#Algorithm without:set
----------------------
1.Initialize an empty string to store the unique characters.
2.Iterate through each character in the input string.
3.For each character, check whether it already exists in the unique characters string.
4.If not, add it to the unique characters string.
5.We manually check whether a character exists in the uniqueChars string using our custom containsChar() function.
6.If not found, we add it to the uniqueChars string.
